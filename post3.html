<p><strong>Earth</strong>, third planet from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sun">Sun</a>&nbsp;and the fifth largest planet in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/solar-system">solar system</a>&nbsp;in terms of size and mass.

It is designated by the symbol ♁. Earth’s name in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/English-language">English</a>, the international language of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/astronomy">astronomy</a>, derives from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Old-English-language">Old English</a>&nbsp;and Germanic words for&nbsp;<em>ground</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>earth</em>, and it is the only name for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/planet">planet</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/solar-system">solar system</a>&nbsp;that does not come from Greco-Roman mythology.</p>

<p>Since the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Copernican-Revolution">Copernican revolution</a>&nbsp;of the 16th century, at which time the Polish astronomer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicolaus-Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus</a>&nbsp;proposed a Sun-centred&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Copernican-system">model</a>&nbsp;of the universe (<em>see</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/heliocentrism">heliocentric system</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enlightened">enlightened</a>&nbsp;thinkers have regarded Earth as a planet like the others of the solar system.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Concurrent">Concurrent</a>&nbsp;sea voyages provided practical proof that Earth is a globe, just as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Galileo-Galilei">Galileo</a>’s use of his newly invented telescope in the early 17th century soon showed various other planets to be globes as well. It was only after the dawn of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/space-physics-and-metaphysics">space</a>&nbsp;age, however, when photographs from rockets and orbiting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/spacecraft">spacecraft</a>&nbsp;first captured the dramatic curvature of Earth’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/horizon-astronomy">horizon</a>, that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conception">conception</a>&nbsp;of Earth as a roughly spherical planet rather than as a flat entity was verified by direct&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/human-being">human</a>&nbsp;observation. Humans first witnessed Earth as a complete orb floating in the inky blackness of space in December 1968 when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Apollo-space-program">Apollo</a>&nbsp;8 carried astronauts around the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Moon">Moon</a>. Robotic space probes on their way to destinations beyond Earth, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Galileo-spacecraft">Galileo</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Near-Earth-Asteroid-Rendezvous-Shoemaker">Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous</a>&nbsp;(NEAR) spacecraft in the 1990s, also looked back with their cameras to provide other unique portraits of the planet.</p>

<p>Viewed from another planet in the solar system, Earth would appear bright and bluish in colour. Easiest to see through a large telescope would be its atmospheric features, chiefly the swirling white&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/cloud-meteorology">cloud</a>&nbsp;patterns of midlatitude and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/tropical-storm">tropical storms</a>, ranged in roughly latitudinal belts around the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/planet">planet</a>. The polar regions also would appear a brilliant white, because of the clouds above and the snow and ice below. Beneath the changing patterns of clouds would appear the much darker blue-black oceans, interrupted by occasional tawny patches of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/desert">desert</a>&nbsp;lands. The green landscapes that harbour most human life would not be easily seen from space. Not only do they&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitute">constitute</a>&nbsp;a modest fraction of the land area, which itself is less than one-third of Earth’s surface, but they are often obscured by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/cloud-meteorology">clouds</a>. Over the course of the seasons, some changes in the storm patterns and cloud belts on Earth would be observed. Also prominent would be the growth and recession of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/winter">winter</a>&nbsp;snowcap across land areas of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Earth’s surface is traditionally subdivided into seven continental masses:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Africa">Africa</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Antarctica">Antarctica</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Asia">Asia</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Australia">Australia</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Europe">Europe</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/North-America">North America</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/South-America">South America</a>.

However, it is convenient to consider separate parts of Earth in terms of concentric, roughly spherical layers.

<p>The mean distance of Earth from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sun">Sun</a>&nbsp;is about 149,600,000 km (92,960,000 miles). The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/planet">planet</a>&nbsp;orbits the Sun in a path that is presently more nearly a circle (less eccentric) than are the orbits of all but two of the other planets,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Venus-planet">Venus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Neptune-planet">Neptune</a>. Earth makes one revolution, or one complete orbit of the Sun, in about 365.25 days. The direction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/period-of-revolution">revolution</a>—counterclockwise as viewed down from the north—is in the same sense, or direction, as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/rotation-physics">rotation</a>&nbsp;of the Sun; Earth’s spin, or rotation about its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/axis">axis</a>, is also in the same sense, which is called direct or prograde. The rotation period, or length of a sidereal day (<em>see</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/day">day</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/sidereal-time">sidereal time</a>)—23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds—is similar to that of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mars-planet">Mars</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Jupiter-planet">Jupiter</a>&nbsp;and most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/asteroid">asteroids</a>&nbsp;have days less than half as long, while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mercury-planet">Mercury</a>&nbsp;and Venus have days more nearly comparable to their orbital periods. The 23.44° tilt, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/inclination-of-equator-to-orbit">inclination</a>, of Earth’s axis to its orbital plane, also typical, results in greater heating and more hours of daylight in one hemisphere or the other over the course of a year and so is responsible for the cyclic change of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/season">seasons</a>.</p>

<p>With an equatorial radius of 6,378 km (3,963 miles), Earth is the largest of the four inner, terrestrial (rocky) planets, but it is considerably smaller than the gas giants of the outer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/solar-system">solar system</a>. Earth has a single natural satellite, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/moon-natural-satellite">Moon</a>, which orbits the planet at a mean distance of about 384,400 km (238,900 miles). The Moon is one of the bigger natural satellites in the solar system; only the giant planets have moons comparable or larger in size. Some planetary astronomers consider the Earth-Moon system a double planet, with some similarity in that regard to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/dwarf-planet">dwarf planet</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Pluto-dwarf-planet">Pluto</a>&nbsp;and its largest moon,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Charon-astronomy">Charon</a>.</p>

Departures from the spherical shape and the effect of Earth’s rotation cause gravity to vary with latitude over the terrestrial surface. The average gravitational acceleration at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/sea-level">sea level</a>&nbsp;is about 980 cm/sec<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(32.2 feet/sec<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<p>Earth’s gravity keeps the Moon in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/orbit-astronomy">orbit</a>&nbsp;around the planet and also generates&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/tide">tides</a>&nbsp;in the solid body of the Moon. Such deformations are manifested in the form of slight bulges at the lunar surface, detectable only by sensitive instruments. In turn, the Moon’s mass—relatively large for a natural&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/satellite">satellite</a>—exerts a gravitational force that causes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/tide">tides</a>&nbsp;on Earth. The Sun, much more distant but vastly more massive, also raises tides on Earth. (<em>See</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/celestial-mechanics-physics/Tidal-evolution#ref77439">celestial mechanics: Tidal evolution</a>.) The tides are most apparent as the twice-daily and daily rises and falls of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ocean">ocean</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/water">water</a>, although&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Earth-tide">tidal deformations</a>&nbsp;occur in the solid Earth and in the atmosphere as well (<em>see</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/tide">tide</a>). The movement of the water throughout the ocean&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/basins">basins</a>&nbsp;as a result of the tides (as well as, to a lesser extent, the tidal distortion of the solid Earth) dissipates orbital&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/kinetic-energy">kinetic energy</a>&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/heat">heat</a>, producing a gradual slowing of Earth’s rotation and a spiraling outward of the Moon’s orbit. Currently this slowing lengthens the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/day">day</a>&nbsp;by a few thousandths of a second per century, but the rate of slowing varies with time as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/plate-tectonics">plate tectonics</a>&nbsp;and sea-level changes alter the areas covered by inland&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/bay-coastal-feature">bays</a>&nbsp;and shallow seas.

Whereas both the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sun">Sun</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Jupiter-planet">Jupiter</a>&nbsp;are composed predominantly of these two elements, they could not be retained long on early Earth and rapidly evaporated into interplanetary&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/space-physics-and-metaphysics">space</a>. The high&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/oxygen">oxygen</a>&nbsp;content of Earth’s atmosphere is out of the ordinary. Oxygen is a highly reactive gas that, under most planetary conditions, would be combined with other chemicals in the atmosphere, surface, and crust. It is in fact supplied continuously by biological processes; without life, there would be virtually no free oxygen. The 1.8 parts per million of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/methane">methane</a>&nbsp;in the atmosphere is also far out of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/chemical-equilibrium">chemical equilibrium</a>&nbsp;with the atmosphere and crust: it, too, is of biological origin, with the contribution by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/human-being">human</a>&nbsp;activities far outweighing others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The gases of the atmosphere extend from the surface of Earth to heights of thousands of kilometres, eventually merging with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/solar-wind">solar wind</a>—a stream of charged particles that flows outward from the outermost regions of the Sun. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/composition">composition</a>&nbsp;of the atmosphere is more or less constant with height to an altitude of about 100 km (60 miles), with particular exceptions being water vapour and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ozone">ozone</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The atmosphere is commonly described in terms of distinct layers, or regions. Most of the atmosphere is concentrated in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/troposphere">troposphere</a>, which extends from the surface to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/altitude-angular">altitude</a>&nbsp;of about 10–15 km (6–9 miles), depending on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/latitude">latitude</a>&nbsp;and season. The behaviour of the gases in this layer is controlled by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/convection">convection</a>. This process involves the turbulent, overturning motions resulting from buoyancy of near-surface air that is warmed by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sun">Sun</a>. Convection maintains a decreasing vertical&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/temperature">temperature</a>&nbsp;gradient—i.e., a temperature decline with altitude—of roughly 6&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Celsius-temperature-scale">°C</a>&nbsp;(10.8 °F) per km through the troposphere. At the top of the troposphere, which is called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/tropopause">tropopause</a>, temperatures have fallen to about −80 °C (−112 °F). The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/troposphere">troposphere</a>&nbsp;is the region where nearly all water vapour exists and essentially all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/weather">weather</a>&nbsp;occurs.<a href="https://www.britannica.com/quiz/earth-sciences-fact-or-fiction">BRITANNICA QUIZEarth Sciences: Fact or Fiction?Did life begin on Earth soon after the planet was formed?

<p>The dry,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tenuous">tenuous</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/stratosphere">stratosphere</a>&nbsp;lies above the troposphere and extends to an altitude of about 50 km (30 miles). Convective motions are weak or absent in the stratosphere; motions instead tend to be horizontally oriented. The temperature in this layer increases with altitude.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the upper stratospheric regions, absorption of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ultraviolet-radiation">ultraviolet light</a>&nbsp;from the Sun breaks down molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>); recombination of single oxygen atoms with O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;molecules into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ozone">ozone</a>&nbsp;(O<sub>3</sub>) creates the shielding&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ozone-layer">ozone layer</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Above the relatively warm stratopause is the even more tenuous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/mesosphere">mesosphere</a>, in which temperatures again decline with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/altitude">altitude</a>&nbsp;to 80–90 km (50–56 miles) above the surface, where the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/mesopause">mesopause</a>&nbsp;is defined. The minimum temperature attained there is extremely variable with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/season">season</a>. Temperatures then rise with increasing height through the overlying layer known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/thermosphere">thermosphere</a>. Also above about 80–90 km there is an increasing fraction of charged, or ionized, particles, which from this altitude upward defines the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ionosphere-and-magnetosphere">ionosphere</a>. Spectacular visible&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/aurora-atmospheric-phenomenon">auroras</a>&nbsp;are generated in this region, particularly along approximately circular zones around the poles, by the interaction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/nitrogen">nitrogen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/oxygen">oxygen</a>&nbsp;atoms in the atmosphere with episodic bursts of energetic particles originating from the Sun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earth’s general&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/atmospheric-circulation">atmospheric circulation</a>&nbsp;is driven by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/solar-radiation">energy of sunlight</a>, which is more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/abundant">abundant</a>&nbsp;in equatorial latitudes. Movement of this heat toward the poles is strongly affected by Earth’s rapid rotation and the associated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Coriolis-force">Coriolis force</a>&nbsp;at latitudes away from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Equator">Equator</a>&nbsp;(which adds an east-west component to the direction of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/wind">winds</a>), resulting in multiple cells of circulating air in each hemisphere. Instabilities (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/perturbation-astronomy">perturbations</a>&nbsp;in the atmospheric flow that grow with time) produce the characteristic high-pressure areas and low-pressure storms of the midlatitudes as well as the fast, eastward-moving&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/jet-stream">jet streams</a>&nbsp;of the upper troposphere that guide the paths of storms. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ocean">oceans</a>&nbsp;are massive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/reservoirs">reservoirs</a>&nbsp;of heat that act largely to smooth out variations in Earth’s global temperatures, but their slowly changing currents and temperatures also influence&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/weather">weather</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/climate-meteorology">climate</a>, as in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/El-Nino">El Niño</a>/Southern Oscillation weather phenomenon (<em>see</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/climate-meteorology/Circulation-currents-and-ocean-atmosphere-interaction#ref53254">climate: Circulation, currents, and ocean-atmosphere interaction</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/climate-meteorology/El-Nino-Southern-Oscillation-and-climatic-change#ref301643">climate: El Niño/Southern Oscillation and climatic change</a>).</p>

<p>Earth’s atmosphere is not a static feature of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/environment">environment</a>. Rather, its composition has evolved over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/geologic-time">geologic time</a>&nbsp;in concert with life and is changing more rapidly today in response to human activities. Roughly halfway through the history of Earth, the atmosphere’s unusually high abundance of free&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/oxygen">oxygen</a>&nbsp;began to develop, through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>&nbsp;by cyanobacteria (<em>see</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/blue-green-algae">blue-green algae</a>) and saturation of natural surface sinks of oxygen (e.g., relatively oxygen-poor minerals and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/hydrogen">hydrogen</a>-rich&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/gas-state-of-matter">gases</a>&nbsp;exuded from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/volcano">volcanoes</a>).

<p>Earth’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/climate-meteorology">climate</a>&nbsp;at any location varies with the seasons, but there are also longer-term variations in global climate.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/volcanic-eruption">Volcanic</a>&nbsp;explosions, such as the 1991 eruption of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mount-Pinatubo">Mount Pinatubo</a>&nbsp;in the Philippines, can inject great quantities of dust particles into the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/stratosphere">stratosphere</a>, which remain suspended for years, decreasing atmospheric transparency and resulting in measurable cooling worldwide. Much rarer, giant impacts of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/asteroid">asteroids</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/comet-astronomy">comets</a>&nbsp;can produce even more profound effects, including severe reductions in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/sunlight-solar-radiation">sunlight</a>&nbsp;for months or years, such as many scientists believe led to the mass&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/extinction-biology">extinction</a>&nbsp;of living species at the end of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Cretaceous-Period">Cretaceous Period</a>, 66 million years ago.

<p>The physics of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/hydrogen">hydrogen</a>&nbsp;fusion leads astronomers to conclude that the Sun was 30 percent less luminous during the earliest history of Earth than it is today. Hence, all else being equal, the oceans should have been frozen. Observations of Earth’s planetary neighbours,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mars-planet">Mars</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Venus-planet">Venus</a>, and estimates of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/carbon-group-element">carbon</a>&nbsp;locked in Earth’s crust at present suggest that there was much more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/carbon-dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>&nbsp;in Earth’s atmosphere during earlier periods. This would have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enhanced">enhanced</a>&nbsp;warming of the surface via the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/greenhouse-effect">greenhouse effect</a>&nbsp;and so allowed the oceans to remain liquid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today there is 100,000 times more carbon dioxide buried in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/carbonate-mineral">carbonate rocks</a>&nbsp;in Earth’s crust than in the atmosphere, in sharp contrast to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Venus-planet">Venus</a>, whose atmospheric&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/evolution-scientific-theory">evolution</a>&nbsp;followed a different course. On Earth, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/biome">formation</a>&nbsp;of carbonate shells by marine life is the principal mechanism for transforming carbon dioxide to carbonates; abiotic processes involving liquid water also produce&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/carbonate">carbonates</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/albeit">albeit</a>&nbsp;more slowly. On Venus, however, life never had the chance to arise and to generate carbonates. Because of the planet’s location in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/solar-system">solar system</a>, early Venus received 10–20 percent more sunlight than falls on Earth even today, despite the fainter young Sun at the time. Most planetary scientists believe that the elevated surface&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/temperature">temperature</a>&nbsp;that resulted kept water from condensing to a liquid. Instead, it remained in the atmosphere as water vapour, which, like carbon dioxide, is an efficient&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/greenhouse-gas">greenhouse gas</a>. Together the two gases caused surface temperatures to rise even higher so that massive amounts of water escaped to the stratosphere, where it was dissociated by solar&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ultraviolet-radiation">ultraviolet radiation</a>. With conditions now too hot and dry to permit abiotic carbonate formation, most or all of the planet’s inventory of carbon remained in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Models predict that Earth may suffer the same fate in a billion years, when the Sun&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/exceeds">exceeds</a>&nbsp;its present brightness by 10–20 percent.</p>

<p>Between the late 1950s and the end of the 20th century, the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere increased by more than 15 percent because of the burning of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/fossil-fuel">fossil fuels</a>&nbsp;(e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/coal-fossil-fuel">coal</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/oil-chemical-compound">oil</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/natural-gas">natural gas</a>) and the destruction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/tropical-rainforest">tropical rainforests</a>, such as that of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River">Amazon River</a>&nbsp;basin. Computer models predict that a net doubling of carbon dioxide by the middle of the 21st century could lead to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/global-warming">global warming</a>&nbsp;of 1.5–4.5 °C (2.7–8.1 °F) averaged over the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/planet">planet</a>, which would have profound effects on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/sea-level">sea level</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/agriculture">agriculture</a>. Although this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/conclusion">conclusion</a>&nbsp;has been criticized by some on the basis that the warming observed so far has not kept pace with the projection, analyses of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ocean">ocean</a>&nbsp;temperature data have suggested that much of the warming during the 20th century actually occurred in the oceans themselves—and will eventually appear in the atmosphere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another present concern regarding the atmosphere is the impact of human activities on the stratospheric&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ozone-layer">ozone layer</a>. Complex chemical reactions involving traces of man-made&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/chlorofluorocarbon">chlorofluorocarbons</a>&nbsp;(CFCs) were found in the mid-1980s to be creating temporary holes in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ozone-layer">ozone layer</a>, particularly over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, during polar spring. Yet more disturbing was the discovery of a growing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ozone-depletion">depletion of ozone</a>&nbsp;over the highly populated temperate latitudes, since the short-<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/wavelength">wavelength</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ultraviolet-radiation">ultraviolet radiation</a>&nbsp;that the ozone layer effectively absorbs has been found to cause&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/skin-cancer">skin cancer</a>. International agreements in place to halt the production of the most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/egregious">egregious</a>&nbsp;ozone-destroying CFCs will eventually halt and reverse the depletion, but only by the middle of the 21st century, because of the long residence time of these chemicals in the stratosphere.</p>

<p>Earth’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/hydrosphere">hydrosphere</a>&nbsp;is a discontinuous layer of water at or near the planet’s surface; it includes all liquid and frozen surface waters,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/groundwater">groundwater</a>&nbsp;held in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/soil">soil</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/rock-geology">rock</a>, and atmospheric water vapour. Unique within the solar system, the hydrosphere is essential to all life as it is presently understood. Earth has a surface area of roughly 510,066,000 square km (196,938,000 square miles); almost 71 percent of Earth’s surface is covered by saltwater&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ocean">oceans</a>. The total volume of liquid water on Earth is about 1.39 billion cubic km (332.5 million cubic miles), and it has an average temperature of about 4 °C (39.2 °F), not far above the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/freezing-point">freezing point</a>&nbsp;of water. The oceans contain about 97 percent of the planet’s water volume. The remainder occurs as fresh water, three-quarters of which is locked up in the form of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ice">ice</a>&nbsp;at polar latitudes. Most of the remaining fresh water is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/groundwater">groundwater</a>&nbsp;held in soils and rocks; less than 1 percent of it occurs in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/lake">lakes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/river">rivers</a>. In terms of percentage, atmospheric water vapour is negligible, but the transport of water evaporated from the oceans onto land surfaces is an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integral">integral</a>&nbsp;part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/water-cycle">hydrologic cycle</a>&nbsp;that renews and sustains life.</p>

<p>The hydrologic cycle involves the transfer of water from the oceans through the atmosphere to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/continent">continents</a>&nbsp;and back to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ocean">oceans</a>&nbsp;over and beneath the land surface.

Some of these carbonate rocks are later dragged deep into Earth’s interior by the global process of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/plate-tectonics">plate tectonics</a>&nbsp;(<em>see below</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Earth/The-outer-shell#ref54198">The outer shell</a>) and melted, resulting in a rerelease of carbon dioxide (from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/volcano">volcanoes</a>, for example) into the atmosphere. Cyclic processing of water, carbon dioxide, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/oxygen">oxygen</a>&nbsp;through geologic and biological systems on Earth has been fundamental to maintaining the habitability of the planet with time and to shaping the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/erosion-geology">erosion</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/weathering-geology">weathering</a>&nbsp;of the continents, and it contrasts sharply with the lack of such processes on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Venus-planet">Venus</a>. (Evidence of past episodes of liquid water erosion—and possibly limited amounts of such erosion today—has been found on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mars-planet">Mars</a>.)</p>
